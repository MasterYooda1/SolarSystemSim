# Solar System Simulator

A Simple Python Solar System Simulator built with Euclid's Method for my University Module. It outputs these individual steps to `TwoBodyTest.npy` in a list. The main simulation happens in `Simulation.py` and the logic and calculations are done within class methods like `GetScalDistanceToBody` in `Particle.py`.

## To Do:
- Three or more different numerical approximations for more accurate results /
- Bugfixing
- Work on code efficiency
- Work on presentable and understandable code.
- Separate each step into its relevant file
- Implement Tests to Check for Accuracy with other data.
- Relate the project to some field which the report can be written on. Perhaps Predicting Eclipses on other planets, test data from records of eclipses on Earth etc. (Turns out predicting eclipses requires an insane amount of accuracy, rather than the current 300km inaccuracy after just 5 days)
