# Solar System Simulator

A Simple Python Solar System Simulator built with Euclid's Method for my University Module. It outputs these individual steps to `TwoBodyTest.npy` in a list. The main simulation happens in `Simulation.py` and the logic and calculations are done within class methods like `GetScalDistanceToBody` in `Particle.py`.
